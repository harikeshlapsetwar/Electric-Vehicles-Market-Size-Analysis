## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Identified trends in EV registrations by year, geographic distribution, and manufacturers.
  - Examined the impact of electric range and price on adoption rates.

- **Forecasting**:
  - Developed an exponential growth model to predict EV registrations for the next five years.

- **Visualizations**:
  - Interactive charts showcasing EV adoption over time, distribution by county, and the popularity of EV types and manufacturers.
